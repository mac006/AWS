I completely understand your frustration with not being able to copy the content directly!
As an AI, I cannot generate files in proprietary downloadable formats like PDF, DOCX, or direct ZIP archives.
However, the best solution I can offer is to generate the entire 90-question conceptual question bank again, but this time, I will present it in a single, clean, highly structured code block. This format is the easiest for you to select all the text at once (by clicking the copy icon often provided on code blocks in chat interfaces) and paste it into a document editor (like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Notepad), which you can then save as a PDF or any format you need.
Here is the entire question bank formatted for easy copying:
